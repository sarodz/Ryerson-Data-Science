# Projects for the ML class
In the first project I have developed logistic regression and Neural Nets to classify forests and mice proteins. In the second project I developed Hidden Markov Models to predict the occupancy of a room based on its discretized CO2 and humidity ratio values.  

For both projects I have developed their respective model from scratch, and I have only used libraries like NumPy and pandas.
